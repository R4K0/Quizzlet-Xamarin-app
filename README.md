# Quizzlet-Xamarin-app
An quizzlet app designed specifically for Android, written in Xamarin - Build not tested on iOS, but it runs okay on UWP (UI is straight out designed for android).

The app requires internet access as it sends API GET requests to https://opentdb.com to retrieve categories, and questions with answers.

Android 100% tested and working as designed.
